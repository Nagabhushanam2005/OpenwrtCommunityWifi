# OpenwrtCommunityWifi

## Description

This project is a simple OpenWRT configuration to create a community wifi network. The idea is to have a mesh network of Raspberry Pi 4b devices that can be used to provide internet access to a community. The IEEE802.11s mesh networking protocol with BATMAN routing protocol is used to create the mesh network. The Raspberry Pi 4b devices are configured as mesh gates (access points) that provide internet access to user devices.

## Features

- IEEE802.11s mesh networking protocol
- BATMAN routing protocol

## Firmware Configuration
